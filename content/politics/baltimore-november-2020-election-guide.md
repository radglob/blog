I've written my own little field guides to elections in past years, and distributed them to some
friends. But I figured this year, I'd make it public.

<!--more-->

This year is a really contentious, terrifying, and potentially world-rending election. I could say I
don't care which side you're on, but I'd be lying. I'm not a huge fan of our political system at
all. A two party system forces people to choose the lesser of two evils, and things just get more
evil.

This guide is opinionated. It explains how I'm going to vote, and how I'd like anyone reading to do
the same. Take it with a grain of salt, and please do your own research if you can.

The questions on this year's ballot are as follows:

- [US President and Vice President](#president-and-vice-president)
- [Baltimore City Council President](#baltimore-city-council-president)
- Comptroller
- Baltimore City Council Representative (this will differ based on your city council district)
- Baltimore City Mayor
- Judge of 8th Circuit Court of Maryland (Baltimore City Courts)
- US Congressional Seat (this will differ based on your congressional district)
- Judge of Court of Special Appeals
- Question 1
- Question 2
- Question A
- Question B
- Question C
- Question D
- Question E
- Question F
- Question G
- Question H
- Question I
- Question J
- Question K

# President and Vice President
I hope you got your protest vote out in 2016 if that's the sort of thing you're tickled to do. You
don't have to be happy about how this came to be the only option (I'm certainly not), but grit your
teeth if you have to, and vote for Biden and Harris. None of the secondary candidates have a chance
of winning, and the current administration needs to go.

# Baltimore City Council President
This is between Nick Mosby and Jovani Patterson. I'm frankly not a proponent of either person. If
you haven't followed Baltimore politics, Marilyn Mosby is the State's Attorney for Baltimore. She
has had some suspect expenses, a less than stellar record dealing with police corruption and
misconduct. Even if she had a stronger record, as City Council President, Nick Mosby would control
her budget. This is a pretty glaring conflict of interest, and should alarm people.

That said, Jovani Patterson is running as a Republican in an extremely blue city. His chances of
winning are very unlikely.

If you're going to write in anything on this ballot, this is the one.
