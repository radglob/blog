I've written my own little field guides to elections in past years, and distributed them to some
friends. But I figured this year, I'd make it public.

<!--more-->

This year is a really contentious, terrifying, and potentially world-rending election. I could say I
don't care which side you're on, but I'd be lying. I'm not a huge fan of our political system at
all. A two party system forces people to choose the lesser of two evils, and things just get more
evil.

This guide is opinionated. It explains how I'm going to vote, and how I'd like anyone reading to do
the same. Take it with a grain of salt, and please do your own research if you can.

The questions on this year's ballot are as follows:

- [US President and Vice President - **Biden/Harris**](#president-and-vice-president)
- [Baltimore City Council President - **Nick Mosby**](#baltimore-city-council-president)
- [Comptroller - **Bill Henry**](#comptroller)
- [Baltimore City Council Representative - **Franca Muller Paz, District 12**](#city-council-representative)
- [Baltimore City Mayor - **Brandon Scott**](#baltimore-city-mayor)
- [8th Circuit Court Judges - **Sampson can GTFO**](#8th-circuit-court-judges)
- [US Congressional Seat - **Kweisi Mfume**](#us-congress) (this will differ based on your congressional district)
- [Judge, Court of Special Appeals at Large - **Yes**](#court-of-special-appeals-at-large)
- [Question 1](#question-1)
- Question 2
- Question A
- Question B
- Question C
- Question D
- Question E
- Question F
- Question G
- Question H
- Question I
- Question J
- Question K

# President and Vice President 

I hope you got your protest vote out in 2016 if that's the sort of thing you're tickled to do. You
don't have to be happy about how this came to be the only option (I'm certainly not), but grit your
teeth if you have to, and vote for __Biden and Harris__. None of the secondary candidates have a
chance of winning, and the current administration needs to go.

# Baltimore City Council President

This is between Nick Mosby and Jovani Patterson. I'm frankly not a huge proponent of either person. 
If you haven't followed Baltimore and Maryland politics, Nick Mosby has been around for a while, and
actually has a decent record on paper. He was involved in getting Ban the Box legislation passed at
the state and city level, worked to prevent homes from being sold out from under people due to
unpaid water bills, and a number of other excellent policy changes.

His record isn't perfect. He's about as pro-police as most mainstream Democrats, and offered the
typical double speak claiming that the Baltimore Uprising was "unproductive", while also stating
that there has been historic disinvestment in the communities where the outrage was most visible.
He represented that district at the time.

His own good and bad aside, Marilyn Mosby, his wife, is the State's Attorney for Baltimore. She
has had some suspect expenses, a less than stellar record dealing with police corruption, and there
was her mishandling of the trials of the police charged in the death of Freddie Gray. Even if she 
had a stronger record, as City Council President, Nick Mosby would control her budget. This is a
pretty glaring conflict of interest, and should alarm people.

That said, Jovani Patterson is running as a Republican in an extremely blue city. His chances of
winning are very unlikely.

Nick Mosby is definitely qualified, and has served on the city council prior to this seat. I have
concerns about him, and electing him to the second most powerful seat in the city shouldn't be done
blindly. We, the electorate, need to keep an eye and pressure on him.

# Comptroller
I actually had the pleasure to meet Bill Henry when he was running against then-incumbent Joan Pratt
during the Democratic primary. Comptroller is a very important position in city government, despite
many people not having any idea what they do. Think of them as the city's main accountant.

I don't make a habit of rubbing shoulders with bureaucrats, but Bill struck me as a genuine, honest
person. He's also running unopposed. Still, I would recommend voting for him. This is one of the few
elections I feel no conflict about (and again, not just because he's unopposed).

# City Council Representative
I live in District 12, so you'll need to look into this a bit more if you live in another. I gave the
map a quick look, and about half of the districts even have GOP challengers to the Democratic
candidates.

District 12 is a really cool race though! Robert Stokes, the incumbent, has been in this seat since
2010. The Democratic primary was a very close race, with Philip Westry tailing by 248 votes.
By all accounts, he didn't really have much of a campaign message besides not being Robert Stokes.

Despite being a fixture in Baltimore politics, by all accounts, Stokes is fairly worthless as a
councilman, and is more or less expecting to coast through. Luckily, Franca Muller Paz is running
under the Green Party.

Her campaign is specifically the sort of campaign I want to see from progressive candidates. She's
been a teacher for years, helped file lawsuits with the ACLU to better school conditions, and has
had a phenomenal canvassing and ground game. I had the chance to chat with briefly when she was
canvassing on my street (which, for some reason, the community association in my neighborhood
regularly avoids). She's passionate, engaged, and brings exactly the kind of energy we need in city
government.

If you're in District 12, vote for her. Even if you're not, consider donating to her campaign. She's
received endorsements from the Metro Baltimore Council AFL-CIO, making her the first third party
candidate to have received the endorsement.

This is the only competitive city council race in the city. If she wins, it could embolden more
third-party candidates to run in the future, and really shake up what's possible in the city.

# Baltimore City Mayor
The primary races for Mayor were absolutely insane. Last time I made one of these guides, the
Democratic primary alone took up most of my time, with upwards of 20 candidates.

The general election is much simpler, with essentially three viable options. I'll go from least
viable to most.

## Shannon Wright (GOP)
Shannon Wright is running under the GOP ticket. If you look into her stances, they sound decent on
the surface: focus on education, public safety, and job creation. These are pretty standard lines
for any conservative candidate. Yet, if you try to dig beneath the surface, the ideas get quite
sinister.

Particularly in regards to public safety, she makes fairly empty statements about police reform.
No statements that she'll work towards defunding, obviously. There are remarks about removing
corruption within BPD, but no steps on how to move forward are given. Then things get really bizarre.

She advocates for forming neighborhood anti-crime patrols, ignoring the "civil rights" of drug
dealers in public housing (I only use quotes above because she did on her campaign website), and
advocating for DOJ and HUD to take further steps to stem violent crime.

It's a very anti-poor stance, and doesn't actually address root causes in any way. Hard pass.

## Bob Wallace (Independent)
I'm not going to spend too much time on this guy, because there doesn't really be much to go off of.
He hasn't held any office as far as I can tell, and is trying the tired "businessman-to-politician"
shtick which never really works.

Government isn't a business. It needs to be a good steward of tax funds, but it's not meant to save
money. It's meant to improve everything, for everyone. I know, it already doesn't work like that.
But sticking someone in a representative office from a transactional one, and hoping things will
somehow work out, doesn't make any sense to me. That leaves us with...

## Brandon Scott (Democratic)
The current City Council President, Brandon has been in city government for a third of his life, and
he's 36. I've never interacted with him directly, and while I don't have any glowing recommendations,
he's definitely the best choice for Mayor.

I suppose I could lob some complaint about how if he's been in office for so long, and things are the
way they are, why not try someone new? Because this is a **strong mayor** city. Time for a little
talk about how the Board of Estimates works.

The Board of Estimates is the body that effectively decides where city funds go. There are 5 seats
in total. One goes to the Comptroller, one to the Mayor, and one to the City Council President. The
remaining seats go to the City Solicitor, and the Director of the board. Those last two seats are
appointed by the Mayor, so they effectively control those seats, too. The mayor has majority decision
power on how funds are spent, and therefore, what happens.

I think Brandon would make a fine mayor. Give him your vote.

# 8th Circuit Court Judges
I'm sorry for mostly mailing this one in. Judges are not nearly as straightforward to get information
about. I'm not a lawyer, and I try to stay as far away from the legal profession and anything
connected to it. Everything I know about Baltimore City judges, I've gleaned from the
[Baltimore Courtwatch](https://twitter.com/bmorecourtwatch) and [BALT](https://twitter.com/BALTLegal)
twitter feeds.

I can't say much about most of them, but Sampson seems to toss out Held Without Bond (HWOB) judgements
more than seems necessary, so I think he should probably go.

Again, talk to someone else about this.

# US Congress
I'm in District 7, so it's race between Kweisi Mfume and Kim Klacik. There are two other independent
candidates, Amber Ivey and Gary Schuman. No offense to either of the independents, but I've never
heard their names come up until I started doing more research for this. And in the case of Schuman,
there's not a lot to go on.

If I felt more confidence it wouldn't be a vote tossed into the void, I'd suggest considering Ivey.
She looks to have a decent professional background beneath her, working in private industry before
transitioning to the public and non-profit sectors as a data and policy analyst. Definitely not the
worst kind of person to have in Congress. Also, she's not old.

I don't say this to come across as ageist. I'm just pretty over the gerontocracy we're currently in.
Representative terms are only two years in theory, but I'm not about to elect anyone in their 70s
unless their politics are radical. Sadly, Mfume's do not appear to be, at least by current standards.

I would still recommend voting for him. The only other viable candidate is Klacik, and I have
nothing good to say about her. She seems to have used her entire campaign to bash Baltimore. She
seems to be running more of a fear-based mayoral or city council campaign than anything else. I don't
appreciate it. Hard pass on [Ruin Porn Barbie](https://twitter.com/KimberlyWriter/status/1302636832161697798).

If you're in another Congressional district, and you might be, please do some research. It's a general
election, and if you're reading this, you're not likely to vote for a Republican anyway. But do your
research. Third party candidates do exist, and can run solid campaigns.

# Court of Special Appeals at Large
As with the above judges, I don't really know how to find conclusive evidence one way or the other.
However, looking at Judge Wells' professional history, he seems to have a bent towards equal rights.

I'm voting yes, but I don't feel comfortable saying what anyone else should do.
